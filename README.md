This is a currency converter app that helps users convert US dollars into realtime Bitcoin value by fetching a coingecko API. The original site website code is in the index.html file and index.js that contains code for the conversion of BTC into USD.
Additionally using the interchange button users can convert USD into BTC and the code for that is contained in index-rev.html and index-rev.js files.
The CSS files for both the sites are common to keep the theme same.
